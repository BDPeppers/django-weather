🌤️ Vite + Tailwind + Django Weather App

🚀 Project Overview
A "learn-by-doing" project using Python and Django. I aimed to build a full-stack application using Vite + Django and to establish communication between the front and back end. 
This project allowed me to explore Django in-depth and gain hands-on experience in effective frontend-backend integration with new technoligies
